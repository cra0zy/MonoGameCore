This repo contains a hacky .Net Core port of MonoGame DesktopGL. It is meant to be used on Linux, but you can use it on Windows and Mac as well by just swapping the Linux native library names with Windows/Mac ones and also including the corrent native libraries.

If you are running this from Linux do note that you'll have to install `SDL 2.0.5`, `SDL Mixer` and `OpenAL` (or have them placed in the output directory).

If you don't know how to use this repo than wait for it to get to the main MonoGame repo where everything will be automated.
